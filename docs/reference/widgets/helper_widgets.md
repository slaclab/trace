# Helper Widgets

## Color Button

The Color button is a button that allows users to select a color for properties in Trace. The button is shown as a blank button in its current color (may be determined by a color palette).

Clicking the button will open a color selection dialog window in the style of the user's OS. Here is where they are able to select a new color.

Right-clicking the button will reset the button's color to its "default" color, which was its initial color on creation.

## Frozen Table View

The Frozen Table View is an object that will display tabular data while keeping the leftmost column visible on the table at all times. This prevents users from scrolling left-right and hiding the leftmost column.
